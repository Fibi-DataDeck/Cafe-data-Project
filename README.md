# Cafe Sales Data Analysis â˜•


## Project Overview

This project, based on the Cafe Sales Dataset focused on extensive cleaning and transforming before meaningful analysis and visualizations could be made. The source of the dataset is "dirty_cafe_sales.csv", and the clean version is "cafe_cleaned".

## Project Objective
The goal of this project was to transform the raw and dirty dataset into a clean and usable dataset for analysis. From which, interactive Power BI dashboards can be build to identify data quality gaos and sales insights.

## Approach
### Data Cleaning/Preparation
- Standardize missing values and errors: 
- Recalculate missing values: `Price Per Unit` , `Quality`,`Total Spent`
- Remove invalid and blank rows: `Transaction Date`
- Add data quality flags for data completeness: `Location`, `Payment Method`

### Exploratory Data Analysis 
#### Key Insights
The key insights from the EDA process of the cafe data sales analysis sought to identify:
- Sales revenue trends to identify seasonal demand
- Product performance: top and lowest selling products
- Preferred payment methods
- Location analysis: top and lowest performing branches
- Data quality gaps: quantifying the impact of incomplete data eg. misssing loacations on reporting accuracy.

## Tools Used 
- Power BI Power Query- Data cleaning
- Power BI- Data modeling, DAX calculations, Dashboard building

## Outcome

The final dataset is clean, consistent, traceable and ready for use for accurate analysis and reporting
